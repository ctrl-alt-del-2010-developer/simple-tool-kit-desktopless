🛡️ Simple Tool Kit – A Cybersecurity Tool for Beginners

🎯 Project Purpose
Simple Tool Kit is a lightweight, beginner-friendly cybersecurity toolkit designed to help newcomers 
take their first steps in the field of ethical hacking and network security. Unlike complex professional tools,
this project focuses on simplicity, 
clarity, and hands-on learning by bundling basic utilities into a single, easy-to-use package.

👥 Target Audience
This toolkit is ideal for:
Students and enthusiasts who are just getting started with cybersecurity
People who have basic Linux/terminal skills and want to explore security tools
Self-learners or hobbyists looking for safe, offline security practice
Instructors or mentors teaching the fundamentals of ethical hacking

🧰 What’s Inside?
The toolkit includes several basic but essential cybersecurity tools for information gathering, basic scanning, 
and simple encoding/decoding operations.
Included tools may cover:
IP and domain information gathering
Basic port scanning (using tools like nmap)
Whois lookups
DNS and HTTP header analysis
Encoding/decoding methods (Base64, ROT13, etc.)
The project is primarily built using Python (≈85%) and Shell scripting (≈14%), which ensures portability and scriptability for command-line use.

🔍 Why This Project?
Getting started in cybersecurity can be overwhelming. Most of the powerful tools used in the 
industry are either too complex or require prior knowledge. 
This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, offering a hands-on experience without the intimidation factor.
Think of Simple Tool Kit as a “training ground” before diving into tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, or Wireshark.
