# 🛡️ Simple Tool Kit – A Cybersecurity Tool for Beginners

**Simple Tool Kit** is a lightweight, beginner-friendly cybersecurity toolkit designed to help newcomers take their first steps in the field of ethical hacking and network security. Unlike complex professional tools, this project focuses on simplicity, clarity, and hands-on learning by bundling basic utilities into a single, easy-to-use package.

## 👥 Target Audience

This toolkit is ideal for:

- Students and enthusiasts who are just getting started with cybersecurity  
- People who have basic Linux/terminal skills and want to explore security tools  
- Self-learners or hobbyists looking for safe, offline security practice  
- Instructors or mentors teaching the fundamentals of ethical hacking

## 🧰 What’s Inside?

The toolkit includes several basic but essential cybersecurity tools for:

- IP and domain port scanner,
- DDoS Tool, 
- DNS and HTTP header analysis and whois scanner (Three In One),  
- Tor Ip Tool etc.
- Sql injection (Sqlmap)

> Built using **Python (≈85%)** and **Shell (≈14%)**, ensuring both portability and scriptability.

## 🔍 Why This Project?

Starting cybersecurity can be overwhelming. Most powerful tools are complex or require prior knowledge. Simple Tool Kit bridges the gap between learning and doing, offering a safe space to experiment and practice before diving into tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, or Wireshark.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del-2010-developer/simple-tool-kit.git
   cd simple-tool-kit
   cd STK
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo bash setup.sh
   ```

3. Run the toolkit (Please Do Not Run This Script İf you Have Root Permissions):
